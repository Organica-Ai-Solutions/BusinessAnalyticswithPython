# Chapter 2: Defining the Landscape - Key Business Questions Answered by Retail Data

## Introduction to Business Questions in Retail

Retail sales data holds the key to unlocking a deeper understanding of business performance and customer behavior. By formulating the right questions, organizations can transform raw data into actionable intelligence. These questions can be broadly categorized based on their focus: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive.

## Categories of Business Questions

### 1. Descriptive Questions

Descriptive questions focus on summarizing past and present data. Examples include:
- What were the total sales during the second quarter of this year?
- How do these sales compare to the same period last year?
- Which product categories generated the highest revenue?

Understanding these basic facts provides a crucial foundation for further analysis. For instance, knowing the best-selling products allows retailers to prioritize inventory and marketing efforts. Furthermore, tracking the performance of sales collateral reveals which materials are most effective in engaging customers.

### 2. Diagnostic Questions

Diagnostic questions aim to uncover the reasons behind observed phenomena:
- Why were sales higher in the second quarter compared to the first?
- Why did a particular marketing campaign underperform expectations?
- What factors contributed to a decrease in foot traffic in a specific store?

These questions help businesses understand the drivers of success and failure. For example, analyzing why certain sales collateral performs better than others can inform future content creation strategies.

### 3. Predictive Questions

Predictive questions leverage historical data and trends to forecast future outcomes:
- What are the projected sales for the next quarter?
- When is a customer likely to make their next purchase?
- What will be the demand for a specific product during the upcoming holiday season?

Predictive analytics enables proactive decision-making. Survival analysis can provide insights into customer purchase timing, while econometric modeling reveals the impact of various factors on sales.

### 4. Prescriptive Questions

Prescriptive questions explore potential outcomes of different actions:
- Will lowering the price of a specific product increase overall sales?
- Should we allocate more marketing budget to online channels or physical stores?
- What is the optimal staffing level for a store during peak hours?

## Retail-Specific Business Questions

Beyond these general categories, several retail-specific questions can be addressed:

1. **Store Operations**
   - How do customers interact with the physical space?
   - What are the optimal store layouts and merchandising strategies?
   - How should staffing levels be adjusted for maximum efficiency?

2. **Customer Behavior**
   - What are the patterns in impulse buying vs. research-oriented purchasing?
   - Which product categories do customers frequently browse together?
   - What indicators might predict customer churn?

3. **Marketing and Promotions**
   - What is the ROI of different marketing initiatives?
   - How effective are various promotional strategies?
   - Which customer segments respond best to specific promotions?

4. **Inventory Management**
   - What are the optimal reorder points for different products?
   - How can we minimize stockouts while avoiding overstocking?
   - What is the impact of seasonality on inventory needs?
